----

**aiosteady** is an MIT licensed library, written in Python, for rate limiting
in asyncio applications using Redis and the aioredis_ library.

aiosteady currently implements the `leaky bucket algorithm`_ in a very efficient way.

.. code-block:: python
    
    max_capacity = 10  # The bucket can contain up to 10 drops, starts with 0
    drop_recharge = 5.0  # One drop recharges every 5 seconds.
    throttler = Throttler(aioredis, max_capacity, drop_recharge)

    # consume() returns information about success, the current bucket level,
    # how long until the next drop recharges, etc.
    res = await throttler.consume(f'user:{user_id}')

.. _`leaky bucket algorithm`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket

Installation
------------

To install aiosteady, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install aiosteady


Usage
-----

The leaky bucket algorithm follows a simple model.

* A single bucket contains a number of drops, called the bucket level. Buckets start with zero drops.
* Buckets have a maximum capacity of drops.
* Each use of the bucket (consumption) inserts one or more drops into the bucket, up until the maximum capacity. If the bucket would overflow, the consumption fails.
* One drop leaks out every `drop_recharge` seconds, freeing space in the bucket for a new drop to be put into it.

* In addition to making the consumption fail, full buckets can optionally be configured to block further attempts to consume for a period.

Create an instance of ``aiosteady.leakybucket.Throttler``, giving it an instance
of an ``aioredis`` client and rate limiting parameters (the maximum bucket
capacity, the number of seconds it takes for a drop to leak out, and an
optional blocking duration).

A ``Throttler`` supports two operations: consuming and peeking.

* ``await Throttler.consume("a_key")`` (``consume`` because it consumes bucket resources)
  attempts to put the given number of drops (default 1) into the bucket at the
  given key. It returns an instance of ``aiosteady.leakybucket.ThrottleResult``,
  with fields for:

  * ``success``: a boolean, describing whether the consumption was successful
  * ``level``: an integer, describing the new level of the bucket
  * ``until_next_drop``: a float, describing the number of seconds left after the next drop regenerates
  
  * ``blocked_for``: an optional float, if blocking is being used and the bucket is blocked, the number of seconds until the block expires

* ``await Throttler.peek("a_key")`` returns the same ``ThrottleResult`` but without attempting to
  consume any drops.

Both operations are implemented using a single Redis call, using Lua scripting.

The Lua Redis script for atomic leaky bucket has been taken and heavily adapted from the Prorate_ project.
